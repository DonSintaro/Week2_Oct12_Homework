# Week2_Oct12_Homework
UT Bootcamp
Bootstrap version of previous portfolio assignment.

Issue I ran into:
I got a little confused about requirements for this one. The requirements stated that it needed to be worked in the same manner as the previous assignment, however, with bootstrap and it's requirements.  That meant that the 960 pixel requirement was still fair play.  That being said, on a 4k aspect ratio, it would not be easily possible to have a footer that sat on the bottom of page because there would not be enough content to fill the page at that dimension  (the 960 px constraint forced content to not be responsive on larger screen sizes, thus, its area did not increase).  The only way I could fix that and make it look ok was by applying a fixed positioning in relation to screen to work around it.
